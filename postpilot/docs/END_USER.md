## What Is PostPilot?

PostPilot is a social media automation tool that helps you manage your business presence across Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok from a single dashboard. Instead of logging into each platform separately, you can create posts, generate AI-powered captions, schedule content in advance, and track how your posts perform -- all in one place.

Whether you run a dropshipping store, an e-commerce business, or a personal brand, PostPilot saves you time by automating the repetitive parts of social media marketing.

## Features

### Social Accounts

Connect your Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok accounts to PostPilot. Once connected, you can create and schedule posts for any of your linked accounts. Disconnecting an account preserves your post history and analytics -- nothing is lost.

**What you can do:**
- Connect Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok accounts
- View all connected accounts and their status
- Disconnect accounts at any time (your history is preserved)
- See when each account was connected

### Posts

Create social media posts with captions, images, and hashtags. Save them as drafts to work on later, or schedule them for automatic publication at a specific time. Filter your posts by status (draft, scheduled, posted) or platform to stay organized.

**What you can do:**
- Create posts with text, media URLs, and hashtags
- Save posts as drafts for later editing
- Schedule posts for a future date and time
- Edit or delete draft and scheduled posts
- Filter posts by status or platform
- View paginated post lists

### AI Content Queue

The content queue is where PostPilot really shines. Add your product information (name, description, price, image) and let AI generate engaging captions automatically. Review the generated content, approve what you like, reject what you don't, and send approved content to your schedule.

**How it works:**
1. **Add a product** -- Enter your product title, description, price, and image URL
2. **Choose platforms** -- Select which platforms (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) to target
3. **Generate caption** -- Click "Generate Caption" and AI creates a platform-specific caption with relevant hashtags
4. **Review** -- Read the generated content and decide if it works for your brand
5. **Approve or reject** -- Approved items move toward scheduling; rejected items can be deleted

**What you can do:**
- Add products to the content queue
- Generate AI captions with one click
- Choose between casual, professional, playful, or engaging tones
- Approve or reject generated content
- Delete pending or rejected items
- Generate standalone captions without adding to the queue

### Calendar

The calendar view shows all your scheduled posts organized by date. See at a glance how much content you have lined up for the coming days and weeks. This helps you maintain a consistent posting schedule and avoid gaps in your social media presence.

**What you can do:**
- View upcoming scheduled posts by date
- See how many posts are scheduled per day
- Plan your content calendar up to 14 days ahead

### Analytics

Track how your posts perform after publication. PostPilot shows you key engagement metrics for each post and provides an aggregated overview across all your accounts. Use these insights to understand what content resonates with your audience and optimize your strategy.

**Metrics tracked:**
- **Impressions** -- How many times your post was displayed
- **Reach** -- How many unique people saw your post
- **Likes** -- Number of likes or reactions
- **Comments** -- Number of comments
- **Shares** -- Number of shares or reposts
- **Clicks** -- Number of link clicks
- **Engagement Rate** -- Calculated as (likes + comments + shares) / impressions

**What you can do:**
- View an overview of your total social media performance
- Drill down into metrics for individual posts
- Compare performance across platforms
- Identify your best-performing content

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use PostPilot without the dropshipping platform?

Yes. PostPilot is a standalone product. You can register directly and use it to manage social media for any business, not just dropshipping.

### What happens when I disconnect a social account?

Your post history and analytics are preserved. Disconnecting only removes the active connection, so you can reconnect later without losing data.

### How does AI caption generation work?

You provide product information (title, description, price), and PostPilot generates a caption tailored to your chosen platform and tone. The AI creates platform-specific formatting -- for example, TikTok captions include trending hashtags, while Instagram captions focus on engagement-driving language.

### Can I edit AI-generated captions?

Yes. Generated captions are suggestions. You can review, edit, and refine them before approving and scheduling.

### What is the content queue?

The content queue is a structured workflow for turning product information into social media posts. Instead of writing every caption from scratch, you add products and let AI draft the content. You then review, approve or reject, and schedule the approved content.

### How do I upgrade my plan?

Navigate to **Billing** in the sidebar. You will see all available plans with their features and pricing. Click the upgrade button on your desired plan to start the checkout process.

### What are API keys for?

API keys allow you to integrate PostPilot with other tools and services programmatically. For example, you could automatically add products to the content queue when new items are added to your store. API keys are available on Pro and Enterprise plans.

### Is my data secure?

OAuth tokens for connected social accounts are encrypted and never exposed in API responses. API keys are hashed with SHA-256 and only shown once at creation time. All endpoints require authentication, and data is fully isolated between users -- no one else can see your accounts, posts, or analytics.
