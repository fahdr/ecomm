Write docs for types of users.
1. **Developer**: A software engineer who will be working on the codebase, implementing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the project.
2. **Project Manager**: A non-technical stakeholder responsible for overseeing the project, tracking progress, and ensuring that the project meets its goals and deadlines.
3. **QA Engineer**: A quality assurance specialist who will be responsible for testing the application, identifying bugs, and ensuring that the product meets quality standards before release.
4. **End User**: The final consumer of the product, who will interact with the application through the dashboard and storefront, using its features to manage their dropshipping business.


Every code and function/method should have a docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values. This is crucial for maintaining code readability and helping other developers understand the functionality of the code. Additionally, comments should be used to explain complex logic or important decisions made in the code. This practice not only aids in collaboration but also ensures that the codebase remains maintainable and scalable as the project evolves.
