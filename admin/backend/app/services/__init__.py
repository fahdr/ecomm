"""
Business logic services for the Super Admin Dashboard.

For Developers:
    Service modules contain reusable logic decoupled from HTTP handlers.
    ``auth_service`` handles JWT creation/verification and password hashing.

For QA Engineers:
    Services can be unit-tested independently of FastAPI routes.

For Project Managers:
    Separating business logic into services improves testability
    and allows the same logic to be reused across multiple endpoints.

For End Users:
    These services power the admin dashboard's security and
    management features behind the scenes.
