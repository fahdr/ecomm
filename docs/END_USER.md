## What Is This Platform?

The Dropshipping Platform is an all-in-one tool for running an online dropshipping business. It handles everything from finding trending products to setting up your store, processing customer orders, and automating marketing — so you can focus on growing your business.

## Two Interfaces

### Dashboard (For Store Owners)

The Dashboard is your control center. From here you can:

- Create and configure your online store
- Add and manage products (manually or via AI-powered import)
- View and fulfill customer orders
- Monitor store performance with analytics
- Manage your subscription and billing
- Configure email automation and SEO settings

### Storefront (For Your Customers)

The Storefront is what your customers see when they visit your store. Each store gets its own web address (e.g., `mystore.platform.com`). Customers can:

- Browse your product catalog
- View product details, images, and variants
- Add items to their shopping cart
- Check out securely via Stripe
- Receive order confirmation

## Planned Features

The platform is being built in phases. Here's what's coming:

### Store Management
- **Store creation** — Set up a new store with a name, niche, and description. Your store automatically gets a unique web address.
- **Product management** — Add products with titles, descriptions, pricing, images, and variants (sizes, colors, etc.).
- **Order management** — View incoming orders, track status, and see customer details.

### AI-Powered Automation
- **Product research** — The platform analyzes trends daily from multiple sources and recommends winning products for your niche.
- **One-click import** — Import a recommended product into your store. AI generates optimized titles, descriptions, and SEO metadata automatically.
- **SEO automation** — Auto-generated sitemaps, schema markup, and AI-written blog posts to drive organic traffic.

### Payments & Billing
- **Customer checkout** — Secure payment processing via Stripe.
- **Platform subscriptions** — Choose a plan that fits your business.

### Marketing
- **Email automation** — Welcome emails, abandoned cart reminders, order confirmations, and daily research reports — all sent automatically.
