# End User Guide — Dropshipping Platform

## What is the Dropshipping Platform?

The dropshipping platform lets you create and manage online stores without holding
inventory. When a customer places an order, the platform automatically forwards it
to your supplier who ships directly to your customer.

## Service Activity

### What are Service Notifications?

When you connect AI services (like TrendScout, ContentForge, RankPilot, etc.) to
your store, the platform automatically notifies them about important events:

- **New product added** — AI tools start generating content, SEO, and ads
- **Product updated** — Connected tools refresh their data
- **New order placed** — Email and competitor tools are notified
- **Order shipped** — Email automation sends tracking updates
- **New customer registered** — Email flows welcome the customer

### Viewing Service Activity

1. Open your store dashboard
2. Click **Service Activity** in the sidebar (under AI & Automation)
3. View the activity log showing every notification sent to your services

### Activity Page Features

- **Summary cards**: Total events, success rate, average latency, failures
- **Filters**: Filter by event type, service name, or status (success/failed)
- **Pagination**: Browse through your full delivery history
- **Per-event details**: See which service received what, when, and if it succeeded

### Product & Order Service Status

On each product or order detail page, you'll see a **Connected Services** panel
showing which AI tools have been notified about that specific item:
- Green check: Service was notified successfully
- Red X: Notification failed (the system will retry)
- Gray dash: Service not yet notified

### Services Hub

Visit the **Services** page to see all 8 available AI tools:
- TrendScout — AI product research
- ContentForge — AI content generation
- RankPilot — SEO automation
- FlowSend — Email marketing
- SpyDrop — Competitor monitoring
- PostPilot — Social media automation

Each service card shows health indicators (last event status, failure count) so
you can quickly spot any issues with your integrations.
