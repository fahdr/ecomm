## What Is AdScale?

AdScale is an ad campaign management tool designed for e-commerce store owners. Instead of logging into Google Ads and Meta Ads Manager separately, you manage everything in one place.

## Features

### Ad Account Connection

Connect your existing Google Ads or Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads accounts to AdScale. Once connected, you can create and manage campaigns directly from the AdScale dashboard.

- Go to **Settings** to connect a new ad account
- Choose **Google Ads** or **Meta Ads**
- Enter your account credentials to link the account
- You can connect multiple accounts across platforms
- Disconnecting an account preserves your campaign history

### Campaign Management

Campaigns are the core of AdScale. Each campaign has an objective, a budget, and a date range.

**Campaign Objectives:**

| Objective | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| Traffic | Driving clicks and website visits to your store |
| Conversions | Getting purchases or sign-ups from your ads |
| Awareness | Maximizing impressions and brand visibility |
| Sales | Optimizing directly for product sales (ROAS-focused) |

**Budget Options:**
- **Daily Budget** -- Set a maximum daily ad spend (e.g., $50/day)
- **Lifetime Budget** -- Set a total budget for the entire campaign duration (e.g., $5,000 total)

**Campaign Statuses:**
- **Draft** -- Campaign is being set up, not yet running
- **Active** -- Campaign is live and delivering ads
- **Paused** -- Campaign is temporarily stopped (you can resume anytime)
- **Completed** -- Campaign has ended

### Ad Groups

Within each campaign, you create ad groups to target different audiences. Each ad group can have its own:

- **Targeting** -- Define who sees your ads (age, interests, locations)
- **Bid Strategy** -- How you want to pay for ad delivery:
  - *Manual* -- You set the exact cost-per-click bid
  - *Auto CPC* -- The platform optimizes your bid for clicks
  - *Target ROAS* -- Optimize for a specific return on ad spend
  - *Maximize Conversions* -- Get the most conversions within your budget

### AI Ad Copy Generation

Instead of writing ad copy yourself, let AI do it for you. Provide:

1. Your **product name** (e.g., "Smart Watch Pro")
2. A brief **product description** (e.g., "A premium smartwatch with health tracking features")
3. Optionally, your **target audience** (e.g., "Fitness enthusiasts aged 25-45")
4. Optionally, a **tone of voice** (e.g., "energetic", "professional", "luxury", "urgent")

AdScale generates:
- A compelling **headline** for your ad
- An engaging **description** that highlights your product
- A **call-to-action** button text (like "Shop Now", "Learn More", "Buy Now")

You can use the generated copy as-is or edit it to your liking.

### Auto-Optimization Rules

Set up rules to automatically manage your campaigns based on performance. Available rule types:

| Rule Type | What It Does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Pause Low ROAS** | Pauses campaigns with return on ad spend below your threshold | Pause any campaign with ROAS below 1.0 (spending more than earning) |
| **Scale High ROAS** | Increases budget by 20% for campaigns performing above your threshold | Scale campaigns with ROAS above 3.0 (earning $3 for every $1 spent) |
| **Adjust Bid** | Adjusts bidding strategy when performance drops | Lower bids when ROAS falls below target |
| **Increase Budget** | Increases daily budget by 15% for high performers | Boost budget when campaigns exceed ROAS threshold |

You can create rules, activate or deactivate them, and even trigger them manually with the "Execute Now" button to see immediate results.

### Performance Analytics

Track how your campaigns are performing with clear metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Spend** | Total amount spent on ads (in USD) |
| **Revenue** | Total revenue attributed to your ads |
| **ROAS** | Return on Ad Spend (revenue / spend) -- higher is better |
| **CTR** | Click-Through Rate (% of impressions that result in clicks) |
| **CPA** | Cost Per Acquisition (spend / conversions) -- lower is better |
| **Impressions** | How many times your ad was shown |
| **Clicks** | How many times your ad was clicked |
| **Conversions** | How many desired actions (purchases, sign-ups) happened |

You can view:
- **Overview** -- Aggregated metrics across all campaigns
- **Per-Campaign** -- Daily breakdown for a specific campaign
- **Date Range** -- Filter metrics by any time period

## Tips for Success

- **Start small** -- Use the Free tier to test with 1-2 campaigns before upgrading
- **Use AI copy** -- AI-generated ad copy is optimized for click-through rates
- **Set ROAS rules early** -- A "Pause Low ROAS" rule at 0.5 prevents budget waste
- **Check analytics weekly** -- Regular monitoring helps you spot trends and adjust strategy
- **Use daily budgets** -- Daily budgets give you more control than lifetime budgets for ongoing campaigns
- **Target specific audiences** -- Narrow targeting usually performs better than broad targeting
